A Short love story of the experimental new addition to the Array methods - the Flat and FlatMap. We can level flatten any array irrespective of the depth level plus the one opportunity to flatten and map at the same time is a very cool feature coming to JavaScript after the whole Array.smooch episode.

```js {2,3}
// syntax
Array.flat()
Array.flatMap()
```
