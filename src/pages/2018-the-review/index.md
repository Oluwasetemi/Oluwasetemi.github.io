The first full year as a full time developer - Devoting myself to the life long career of software development learning the lifestyle and writing `codes`, most importantly building several things for the web. The nights, the coffee, and bugs - the Joy and frustration engrained in the wonderful 2018 year. It was my first year as a Grad. This was another year of travelling for me. Full of taking responsibilities. I could not be less grateful.

### Conclusion of NYSC - POST NYSC

Finishing NYSC sent waves of fear down my spine thinking of what life will look like as a grad. I was afraid because of the uncertainty that was ahead. I was hopeful i will survive as an optimist. Where will i be heading to after the completion of the compulsory national service to my beloved nation. I wanted something related to academics and i loved computer science so much that i wanted to do software development at a professional level. In all the fear too, I realized that i was not employable according to my own standards.

I have this opinion of "can i employ myself with my current academic and skill level?". I knew i won't be applying for Jobs yet  but i will be building up my skill set to a level that i am comfortable to work for any organization i so much desired. I started processing my master at the University of Ibadan to buy me time to learn JavaScript and Node(More about web development and computer science basics) without telling my parent, only informed a few friends. if you are in this phase of life or will be in years to come - embrace the Journey ahead and be truthful to follow your heart desire and passion not looking at the environment as a yard stick measurement in your decisions.

### My Verdict to stay in Ibadan

Spent all of my early stage in Ibadan mostly with my late mum - Mrs B.T.O Ojo since dad was always away from home in different stations ranging from ogun, osun, ibadan, kano, nasarrawa and finally Abuja as the last based. i could move to Abuja with my step family and work close to daddy or move down west and continue the family legacy or move to Lagos the main tech hub in Nigeria. After reading "Outliers - Malcom Gladwell" - i made a decision to move to Ibadan and stay in my Aunt's apartment in UCH to buy me good access to electricity and move away from relatives monitoring every of my movement. Stay true to your decision irrespective of what people say or think. Staying in UCH will get me prepared for my MSc in UI - University of Ibadan. I opted to setup my workstation - A computer table with keyboard movable tray, i took a new LG TV to extend via HDMI to my crook old 5040 Dell Inspiron with a old Glo netpro modem i inherited from my sister.

### Adversity and Tough Times

I love to listen to Inky Johnson a lot and i like the idea of staying positive during the period of adversities and tough times because it is in them that we are made over and over into the lasting person we desire to be - all loving human being we have dreamed to become who is successful and simple.

The Idea that I was on my own made things hard for me, even the waves of the 19,000 coming to an end is cool enough to make one think. No source of income yet with part of my savings going into my MSc processing and travelling. I have learnt to take responsibility for certain family demands from the early days of my life.

A lot of my family associates wants to know my next move and decision and it was more like intruding to me even though I knew some really cared. I knew i was going to survive because i am an optimist and I attack issues right on before they ever show up. I saved a lot during the NYSC days even though it was little. Yeah the funny part was saving data for learning JavaScript and Programming was very important from. I saved close to 40GB of data and i was able to stay up to date with learning demands until around April when I was stable financially.

### Rejection and Human Plans

Taking life one step at a time is a blessing you can do for yourself at any phase or stage in life. I took this approach with all i was going to be involved in. I was not emotionally attached to anything/ Process/ Idea/ Perspective.

I learnt that my application for MSc was not successful, it made me sad - for the time, effort and money. I wanted MSc for my deep interest in teaching and academics in general. I also knew that Computer Science Education in my country was not anything near the perception of the career in general. I wanted to help and I was told i was not good enough.

My Plans had hit **ROCK END**, no more hiding and how do i tell everyone i had told MSc was the next thing. I was feeling Bad and sorry for me yet like ever, as always I had good hope and i appreciate my life more than ever.

// TODO: a scripture quote of proverbs about human plans and God's superior master better plan.

### EduLight and the Blessing of Teaching

I love teaching and i could live my life teaching over and over - it was part of the gene i inherited from mum and dad together. My teaching days during nysc were without sweat. it was just with ease and i love the blessedness and the opportunity to learn and impact.

I saw a Job advert, I applied and I got the Job - Web Development and Teaching together. Building a modern curriculum for people to learn and build websites with a consulting firm in Dugbe, Ibadan.

I accepted because the pay was good, it offered me time for progression and personal development, it was the most challenging task as i love to be challenged. I drew a new plan and idea and i committed myself to teaching HTML, CSS and JS. Thank you Mr Mayokun Odusote for believing in me despite the challenges.
