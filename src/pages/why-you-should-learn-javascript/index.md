## My Decision

Immediately after university education around December 2015, I made a solemn promise to learn and learn javascript properly. Almost 5 year after the commitment, I am not backing out of my word. I want to learn the wholly and completely and will thus do everything in my power and capacity to stay true to this mere saying of mine.

## Why and What Led me to this Decision

I can't say why on what premise my conclusion is built on but I here are few things that might have led to it.

- I am a failed programmer, all through university education I assumed I could code with just my hot, keen and passionate interest alone but I was wrong.
- The quest of what will I end up doing for living call out to me after my final examination from the Ladoke Akintola University of Technology.
- I have failed at properly, consistently learning C#, Java and Turbo Pascal with GUI.

I could conclude that this 3 reasons are why I have dedicated a large chunk of my life into a thorough learning of JavaScript. A failed programmer during university days, what career will I decide to commit my life into after  university, failing from several efforts to learn something I was very interested in might look so small to others considering what your reason maybe. But for me Oluwasetemi, It was more than enough to prove to myself and other that I was not a failed programmer, nor failing at learning some programming languages a deciding factor to my life outcomes. And finally the quest of a career path where I would be happy and successful were all enough to motivate me to learn properly.

## How do I mean 'Learn properly'

Trying to watch tutorial or reading a book to learn to me seems false as the first step to learning a concept properly. Its like a dead end or road about ( revolving round a spot ). I tried to get more understanding into [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn). That moment you have a clear understanding of your right way to approach learning, you would not struggle with anything in life. You have a clear picture of what your capacity is and how to get the best out of your current capacity. The way we each learn is very different and we need to pay careful attention to approach we take while attempting to learn or distill any concept.

What I found out after I took more time to focus on understanding Learning as a concept, I had the confidence to approach any new Technology or concept. Have a clear picture of what you are about to learn and give yourself to doing a detailed research on how and what approach others have taken towards learning the same thing you are about to learn. My google search history in the 2015's abd 2016's would contain a lot of search results like 'what is the best way to learn javascript', 'what is the best video material to learn javascript', 'what are the table of contents to know to become a good software developer or computer scientist or frontend developer', 'the best blog on learning javascript', 'the best books on learning javascript'.

Of which years after I am still trying to answer the same question of how to learn javascript properly. So if anyone reading this is learning javascript or knows someone who is planning to learn the number one programming language of the web, then I will be your best friend on that journey.

## The answer is close and will be coming in bits over the next coming days.

I will answer in very detailed step with no focus on any material but show you a bit of the all the structure that you can put in place to learn javascript properly. I am not advertising for any material or publisher so I will avoid too much focus on a material but will try to provide a system that can sustain any with little or no experience writing code.

Thank for reading and stay tunned for more on the this topic.
