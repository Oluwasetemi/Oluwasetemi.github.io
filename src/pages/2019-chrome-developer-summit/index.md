I hoped this was going to be my note for the conference but I failed. Taking notes during conferences is very crucial when ever you attend a conference. To keep the journey and sequence of event during the conference. Keep track of talking points during the conference. Creating a document that others who attended or did not attend will get to read as summary about the important highlights of the conference.
