## Starting From Where I left off

> Here is a few tips, research well on the subject(JavaScript) before attempting to learn, Learn enough to build something, Learn JavaScript as a programming language before you learning JavaScript in the browser. Learn more about Frontend Frameworks and build something. Learn JavaScript on the server (Nodejs).

Doing the due diligence on the topic (JavaScript in this case) is as import as what you are trying to learn because it will go down to decide how long (time), cost it will take you during the learning process.

I explained few tips about my process in the first part of this [post](https://oluwasetemi.dev/why-you-should-learn-javascript/). Go over it and start patiently and prepared all because learning is a journey to a destination. Little progress makes the difference. You can learn it all in a day, a week, a month neither will you become and expert in just a year. So prepare to do a proper researching on all ypu will need along the journey.

One few tip _is while you're learning do not call yourself a software developer but rather you could say a code newbie or a developer in making or just avoid the title and name calling completely to keep the focus on the result.

## Learn enough to build something you can show others

The real proof of the journey is the little apps, web page, functions, problem you solved along the journey. So make sure to document the journey. Keeping a diary or journal or blog will be helpful. It shows your commitment and its a testament of your unrelenting effort to allow the process to make you into a developer. I have lots of portfolio to show to this effect while I was learning or what I built while teaching others. Everything should always have a sharable link as this will be a proof in case of validation. Learning enough means at every point you should build something no matter how little you think you have learn.

Show me a developer who is learning how to code with a Github portfolios of his/her works and I will show you a developer who will soon get a job. Focus of solving problems that are tasking and that put to practice what you have learnt rigorously because if you learnt something very easily and you did not solve a tasking problem with it, for your brian and body you might just be playing. (You might not grasp the underlining concept without solving a difficult problem that engage your reasoning and mounts a bit of pressure on you a bit)

## Learn JavaScript as a programming language

## before you learning JavaScript in the browser

## Learn more about Frontend Frameworks and build something
