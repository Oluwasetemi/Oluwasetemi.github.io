A Short love story of the experimental new addition to the Array methods - the Flat and FlatMap. We can **level flat** any irregular array (an array that contains array or arrays) irrespective of the depth level plus the one opportunity to flatten and map at the same time is a very cool feature coming to JavaScript after the whole `Array.smoosh` episode.

### A little Story

Have you ever heard about `#SmooshGate`? TC39 the working group that works on JavaScript(ECMAScript) released ``Array.prototype.flatten` to flatten array recursively up to a specified depth. And it broke the web ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­.

They had to find a quick fix to the bug and save the world. When fixing a bug, why? is very important. They found that MooTools was the cause since it implemented a flatten method that overwrite the default `Array.prototype.flatten`. The proposal author suggested to change the name from flatten to **smoosh**. Strange suggestion? Read more [here](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/03/smooshgate).

It was renamed to `flat` after TC39 met in May 2018 and `Array.prototype.flatMap` was included.

### How do we flatten an Array Before ?

```js{1,4}
const flatten = (arr, depth = 1) =>
  arr.reduce(
    (a, v) =>
      a.concat(depth > 1 && Array.isArray(v) ? flatten(v, depth - 1) : v),
    []
  )
const flattened = arr => [].concat(...arr)
```

```js
function flattenArray(arr) {
  const flattened = [].concat(...arr)
  return flattened.some(item =>
    Array.isArray(item) ? flattenArray(flattened) : flattened
  )
}
```

Use recursion, decrementing depth by 1 for each level of depth. Use Array.prototype.reduce() and Array.prototype.concat() to merge elements or arrays. Base case, for depth equal to 1 stops recursion. Omit the second argument, depth to flatten only to a depth of 1 (single flatten).

### Deep flattens an array

Use recursion. Use Array.prototype.concat() with an empty array ([]) and the spread operator (...) to flatten an array. Recursively flatten each element that is an array.

```js
const deepFlatten = arr =>
  [].concat(...arr.map(v => (Array.isArray(v) ? deepFlatten(v) : v)))
```

### Now Behold your Future

```js
[1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 5, 6].flatMap(
  (v, i) => (Array.isArray(v) ? v.flat() : v)
  )
```
The future is here not Just evenly distributed.
with the two methods, we can flatten an array easily. `flatMap` combines the power of the regular map and flat together.

```js
// Infinity can be used to flatten recursively
[1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 5, 6].flat(Infinity);
// [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]

[1, 2, [3, [4, 5]], 5, 6].flat(1) // flats 1 depth level
// [1, 2, 3, [4, 5], 5, 6]
```
