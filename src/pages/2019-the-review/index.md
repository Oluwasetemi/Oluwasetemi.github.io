Such a huge year with opportunity to prove myself as a software developer. Plenty goals, few were crushed and others I failed at. Plenty learning and lessons, plenty positives to take to the new year and focus on the thing I said was going to do during my last year review and evaluation of my journey.I enjoyed everybit of it and I am excited about what the future holds in faith.

One goal was to write code and get to build products(software) useful and usable. Put all the learning over the year into practice. All the effort of the past years and learning put them together and use more. This is my first year of coding fully as a profession. I am very pleased and happy to be able to share my learning to help me become better each new day.

I met a lot of awesome folks this year ranging from day to day co-workers to community leaders and mentors. Learnt that your net-worth is a true reflection of your network. [Ama]( Link), [Dike]( Link), [Richard]( Link), [Ibrahim]( Link), [MZ]( Link), [Kenny]( Link) became my all day pals at work. Non technical friends like my [Boss]( Link), [Sewa]( ), [Jenny](https://link), [Passion Incubators](https://link) People, Leadspace friends - [Nonye]( Link), [kelvin]( Link) and [Lateefat](https://link), My HubOne Pals, ScholarX team - [Nonso](https://link) and [Adelola - Cake Vendor](https://link) and [MyCrib Team]() and special mention to the hardworking [Theo](https://link) who get us sorted at all time. Kudos to Babajide and the FCMB team for the great community full of impact most especially the world class idea of Epic hours.

My Intern - [Ayokanmi Dammy](https://link)'s progress is glowing, mastering the art of frontend engineering during her compulsory 6 month internship under my watch. We were privilleged to work on some project's together. You did so well my sister from another mother. Keep the progress. Don't despice the days of little beginning. Your progress map is amazing.

## Failures
I was sloppy at times this year yet I knew I just wanted an atmosphere to learn. I failed a lot of times. Just wanting everthing to go smoothly as planned using Todo List and Routines. DId not want to take up fixing legacy codebase with unrealistic timeline and pressure which was very important to my company due to certain reasons. Fixing buggy codebase with poor understanding of the project is an unrealistic effort when I first joined my new team but I had to man up and face the fear at certain points. I failed at starting a podcast.I failed an Andela interview at the 3rd stage. Plenty rejections from Call for papers to speak at developers conference. Personal development dragged, wrote less react code, stuggled with writing automated tests, CI and CD setup and Nodejs design patterns.

## Evolution
The year saw a lot of revolution in the tech space both local and international. Largest tech conference happened in Nigeria and Kenya via [concatenate conf](https://link) and I atteneded the last day and missed out on the workshops.

I saw myself at different level during my time at natterbase. I want to improve and be the best I can ever be as a JavaScript developer. I want to work on more larger codebase amd good agancy with good engineering structure and more projects and better project managers.

I love graphQL and hope to start the Lagos meetup for graphQL soon. I convince my team to try it out for a project and I will write about our experience and what we learnt. I love evrything that has to do with netlify, Apollo, Codesandbox, Paypal and one day hope I will work with these companies. Andela is another dream place I hope to work. After Ibrahim joined and he told me about all the wonderful structure in their setup and system put in place to make developers productive.

I hope to write more TypeScript all year in 2020. Get to learn and master another programming language. Thinking ELixir or Erlang. I must be better with C# and Java with the little I know.

The goal for next year is to build ton of product like Niktta conference talk on building shit ton of project and ideas. Do more open contribution. Really do not know what to expect but I am sure I will give every thing I have within me to better than I was in 2019. Another thing to focus on is building progression with my routine. Speak to my mentors and write more.
